The application is divided into several interactive tabs, each dedicated to a key physical phenomenon. Users can input geometric, material, and fluid properties (such as tube diameter, fluid velocity, viscosity, and material density) via a user-friendly sidebar. 
Key features include:
Natural Frequency Calculation: Computes the first-mode natural frequency of a tube based on elasticity and geometry.
Reynolds Number & Vortex Shedding: Determines flow regime and potential vortex shedding frequency.
Turbulent Buffeting & Fluid Elastic Instability: Estimates fluctuating forces and conditions for instability.
Acoustic Resonance Module: Calculates both axial and angular resonance frequencies, factoring in temperature, pitch type (square or triangular), and fluid properties using the speed of sound
FIV Damage Prediction: Simulates dynamic displacement under fluid forces, visualizes response, and estimates collision risks, noise levels, and wear.
Users can download both a vibration graph and a full text-based report summarizing results such as resonance frequencies, maximum displacement, and potential failure modes (e.g., SCC risk). The app supports real-time engineering insight and troubleshooting for optimizing the mechanical integrity and acoustic performance of heat exchangers in design or operational stages.
